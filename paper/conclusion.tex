We presented a simple, tag-based semantic interpretation 
for nominal types, tuples, and unions, 
and provided a decidable syntactic definition of subtyping 
equivalent to the semantic subtyping on tags.

%where abstract nominal types are interpreted via type tags corresponding 
%to their declared concrete subtypes.
